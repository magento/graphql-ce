## Overview

Welcome to the Magento 2 GraphQL Community Project! 

Here is our [ZenHub board](https://github.com/magento/graphql-ce/wiki/Home/_edit#zenhub), best viewed with the [Chrome ZenHub extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd). Otherwise, our backlog is organized as a [list of issues](https://github.com/magento/graphql-ce/issues). 

For the last few months, the internal team has been hard at work on the initial implementation for GraphQL in Magento. GraphQL is a flexible and performant API for building custom front-end experiences, including headless storefronts and PWAs. To learn more about GraphQL, please visit [graphql.org](https://graphql.org/). To get a head start on the GraphQL implementation in Magento, our DevDocs are [here](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/graphql).

To join the project, attend a regular meeting or join [#graphql](https://magentocommeng.slack.com/messages/C8076E0KS) slack channel.
